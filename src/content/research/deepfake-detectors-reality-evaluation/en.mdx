Deepfakes, particularly those involving faceswap-based manipulations, have sparked significant societal concern due to their increasing realism and potential for misuse. Despite rapid advancements in generative models, detection methods have not kept pace, creating a critical gap in defense strategies.

## Abstract

This disparity is further amplified by the disconnect between academic research and real-world applications, which often prioritize different objectives and evaluation criteria. In this study, we take a pivotal step toward bridging this gap by presenting a novel observation: the post-processing step of super-resolution, commonly employed in real-world scenarios, substantially undermines the effectiveness of existing deepfake detection methods.

## Novel Contributions

### Real-World Dataset

To substantiate this claim, we introduce and publish the first real-world faceswap dataset, collected from popular online faceswap platforms.

### Performance Evaluation

We then qualitatively evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors on real-world deepfakes, revealing that their accuracy approaches the level of random guessing.

### Quantitative Analysis

Furthermore, we quantitatively demonstrate the significant performance degradation caused by common post-processing techniques.

## Key Findings

### Critical Gap Identified

- **Academic vs Reality**: Significant disconnect between academic benchmarks and real-world performance
- **Post-processing Impact**: Super-resolution and other common post-processing steps severely degrade detection accuracy
- **Random Performance**: State-of-the-art detectors perform close to random guessing on real-world data

### Real-World Challenges

- **Platform Variations**: Different online platforms employ various post-processing techniques
- **Quality Enhancement**: Super-resolution improves visual quality but breaks detection methods
- **Evaluation Gaps**: Current academic evaluation doesn't reflect real-world usage

## Practical Impact

By addressing this overlooked challenge, our study underscores a critical avenue for enhancing the robustness and practical applicability of deepfake detection methods in real-world settings.
